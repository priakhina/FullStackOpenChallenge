# Full Stack Open 2023

This repository contains my solutions to exercises for parts 0-7 of the [Full Stack Open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en) offered by the University of Helsinki and their partners and affiliates. The course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with React that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Repository Directories

The repository contains exercises from different parts of the course and uses the following naming scheme for the directories:

-   part_0
    -   exercise_0.4
    -   exercise_0.5
    -   exercise_0.6
-   part_1
    -   courseinfo
    -   unicafe
    -   anecdotes
-   part_2
    -   phonebook
    -   countries
-   ...
    -   ...

Each part of the course has its own directory, which contains a separate directory **_either_** for an individual exercise (e.g., _exercise_0.4_ in _part_0_) **_or_** a series of exercises (e.g., the _courseinfo_ exercises in _part_1_), depending on the course content. In cases where multiple exercises make up a single web application, the end result (i.e., a completed application) is submitted under one directory.
