# FullStackChallenge

This repository is used for submitting exercises for the [Full Stack Open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en). The course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The repository contains exercises from different parts of the course and uses the following naming scheme for the directories:

-   part_0
    -   exercise_0.4
    -   exercise_0.5
    -   exercise_0.6
-   part_1
    -   courseinfo
    -   unicafe
    -   anecdotes
-   part_2
    -   phonebook
    -   countries

Each part of the course has its own directory, which contains a separate directory **_either_** for an individual exercise (e.g., _exercise_0.4_ in _part_0_) **_or_** a series of exercises (e.g., the _courseinfo_ exercises in _part_1_), depending on the course content. In cases where multiple exercises make up a single web application, the end result (i.e., a completed application) is submitted under one directory.
